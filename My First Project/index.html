                    Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy
                    tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people.

                        However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. Look up at
                        the stars and not down at your feet. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty
                        without it. <br>

                    “Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you
                    know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The
                    aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic
                    doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
                    civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful
                    child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar,"
                    every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote
                    of dust suspended in a sunbeam. </p>
                <p>
                    The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by
                    the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some
                    other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how
                    fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so
                    that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. </p>
                <p>
                    Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in
                    the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great
                    enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come
                    from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. </p>
                <p>
                    The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near
                    future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the
                    moment the Earth is where we make our stand. </p>
                <p>
                    It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no
                    better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To
                    me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and
                    cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.” <br> <br>
